   "Do not compete with Kari, Kari comes from God.",
   "Usitukane wagema na ulevi ungalipo.",
   "Speak no ill of palm-wine tappers as long as drinking persists.",
   "Usitukane wakunga na uzazi 'ungalipo.",
   "Speak no ill of midwives while childbirth still continues.",
   "Usiyavuke maji usiyoweza kuyaoga.",
   "Do not cross water that is too deep for wading."
